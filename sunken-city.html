				<h2>Project overview üìù</h2>
				<p>In my consumer marketing class, each group was tasked with forming a pop-up company to brand, market,
					and sell coffee that had been imported from Guatemala. We partnered with the coffee processing co-op
					in San Juan La Laguna, <b><i>La Voz</i></b>, and donated all profits to the <b><i>Organization for
							the Development of the Indigenous Maya (ODIM)</i></b>. <b><i>ODIM</i></b> is a non-profit
					organization whose mission is to enable access to healthcare and preventative health education for
					the population, with equality, honesty, and confidentiality,
					that is focused on programs that promote the development and empowerment of the communities of San
					Pablo La Laguna and San Juan La Laguna. We created the branding for the coffee, a social media
					platform to advertise it, and a website to sell it. With our website,<b><i> we raised over $2000 in
							five days.</i></b></p>

						<h2>Challenge üßó‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</h2>
						<blockquote>
							<p>How can I sell all of our coffee and raise <b><i>$1000</i></b> for ODIM in <b><i>two
										weeks</i></b>?</p>

					<h2>Research üî¨</h2>
					<p>Conducting research on our target audience as well as La Voz and ODIM was essential for
						crafting a compelling story that would encourage customers to purchase our coffee and
						donate.
					<blockquote>
						<h3>Audience</h3>
						<p>Given that we were selling coffee during the holiday season in December, I focused on
							coffee lovers and their families who may consider purchasing our coffee as a gift. I
							also aimed to leverage the holiday spirit of giving to target individuals who cared
							about social causes.</p>
					</blockquote>
					<blockquote>
						<h3>Competition</h3>
						<p>Our competition were other student teams in the class and established coffee brands like
							Starbucks and Peet's.</p>
					</blockquote>
					<blockquote>
						<h3>Interviews</h3>
						<p>We met with the leaders of ODIM to gain a better understanding of the non-profit
							organization and the communities of San Pablo La Laguna and San Juan La Laguna. This was
							crucial for crafting a compelling narrative.</p>
					</blockquote>
			

				<h2>Design process üí≠</h2>
				<p>Initially, I planned to use a website template provided by Wix due to time constraints. However, they all had a modern and minimalistic 
					designs that didn't align with the message we wanted to convey to users. In order to stand out,
					we needed to take a more personalized approach. We aimed to sell our
					story and the unique tales of Guatemala, emphasizing the social impact of the purchase.</p>
				<ul>
					<blockquote>
						<h3>Wireframe</h3>
						<li>I created a basic wireframe for the website and tested it with team members. With feedback I
							received, I was able to improve the information architecture and layout of the website.</li>
						<br>
						<h3>UX Content Strategy</h3>
						<li>I gathered photos from both La Voz and ODIM and produced website content that would contribute to our brand strategy and organized it in a way that users
							could easily process the information.
						</li>
						<li>Next, I chose an earthy and warm color palette to use because I wanted the colors to evoke
							feelings of ‚Äúcoffee‚Äù, ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù, and ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù.</li>
						<br>
						<h3>Prototype</h3>
						<li>Built the prototype from the wireframe and added visual design elements.</li>
						<br>
						<h3>Test</h3>
						<li>Found 5 different users to test the website and give feedback.</li>
						<li>Based on feedback, I came up with the idea to introduce the team and share our morning
							coffee rituals. This "About the Team" page gave our website more personality and connected
							us more with our target audience.</li>
						<li>Lastly, I had users test the website on different devices such as a laptop and phone to
							ensure its intuitiveness and ease of use.</p>

				<h2>Impact üìà</h2>
				Our team achieved remarkable success with our coffee campaign, selling out all the coffee in just
				<b><i>five days</i></b>. We outperformed all the other teams in the class and, as a result, raised over $2000 in profit. <b><i>More than doubling our goal.</i></b> As a class together, we were able to reach our overall goal of $5000
				which was donated to ODIM.</p>
				<h2>Lessons Learned ‚úçÔ∏è</h2>
				<p>Despite not being a product design project, I gained valuable skills that are transferable to such
					projects. If I were to undertake this project again with more time, I would prioritize conducting more user research to
					understand users pain points and create a more visually appealing and intuitive interface using the
					design principles I have learned. I would also create user personas and test the prototype with users that fit more into our target users.</p>
				<p>This project also highlighted the importance of telling a compelling story. By telling the story of the communities in Guatemala and their coffee, the
					team was able to create a better user experience by making meaningful connections with our customers
					and stand out from the competition.</p>
				<p>It was also a team effort and demonstrated the value of collaborating and working together. By leveraging each team member's strengths, we were able to create a successful
					campaign and website. The team encountered many challenges during the project, such as time
					limitations and the unavailability of many resources, which taught me the importance of being
					flexible and adaptable in finding alternative solutions and approaches.</p>
