							<h1 class="major">A Website Design: Sunken City Coffee</h1>
							<h2>December 2020</h2>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/project1/sunken-city2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<h2>Project overview</h2>
							<p>For my final project in my consumer marketing class, each group was tasked with forming a pop-up company to brand, market, and sell coffee that had been imported from Guatemala. We partnered with the coffee processing co-op in San Juan La Laguna, La Voz, and donated all profits to the Organization for the Development of the Indigenous Maya (ODIM). ODIM is a non-profit organization whose mission is to enable access to healthcare and preventative health education for the population, with equality, honesty, and confidentiality, 
								that is focused on programs that promote the development and empowerment of the communities of San Pablo La Laguna and San Juan La Laguna. We created the branding for the coffee, a social media platform to advertise it, and a website to sell it.</p>
							<h3>Goal</h3>
							<p>Our goal was to sell out within one week of publishing the website and raising $5000 together as a class.</p>
							<h3>Constraints</h3>
							<p>Time for building our website and executing a mareketing strategy was extremely limited since our class was only three and a half weeks long. This project was started and completed in only <b><i>two weeks</i></b>.</p>
							<h3>Team Roles</h3>	
							<p>My team split up responsibilities based on these roles:
								<br><b>Process Leader:</b> This person established a project schedule and communicated with the team and professor on how the project progressed during the project.
								<br><b>Creative:</b> This person was tasked with creating content for the website, the brand story, and the package labels.
								<br><b>Order Logistics Manager:</b>  Someone to track orders and match it to inventory levels.
								<br><b>Website Manager:</b>  This person builds and manages the website including e-commerce.
								<br><b>Social Media Manager:</b>  Someone to handle day-to-day sales, social media presence, and build the consumer base.
								<br><b>Finance Manager:</b>  Someone to keep records of all financial transactions, and working with the Colorado College Finance Department to square the books in a transparent and timely manner.</p>
								<p>I was both the <b><i>website manager</i></b> and <b><i>creative</i></b> in this project.</p>
							<h2>Research</h2>
							<p>Before I began jumping into the website design, I knew I had to do research on who we were representing, La Voz and ODIM, and find out who we were selling the coffee to. This was important for telling the story in a compelling way so that customers would be willing to buy a 12oz bag of coffee for $20.</p>
							<h3>Audience</h3>
							<p>Based on our product, goals, and the time of year, we came up with a group of people to target. Since we were selling coffee around the holidays in December, we targeted coffee-lovers and their families who could buy the coffee as gifts. We also wanted to take advantage the “giving” mentality over the holidays to secure purchases and donations for our cause. We targeted people who cared about social issues.</p>
							<h3>Competition</h3>
							<p>We determined our competition to be not only the other four groups from our class but also other popular coffee brands such as Starbucks and Peet's coffee which have holiday gift sets and packaged coffee. In order to stand out from the competition, I decided to take a more personal approach. The customers wouldn't be buying coffee. They would be buying us and the stories of Guatemala.</p>
							<h3>Interviews</h3>
							<p>Because of time restrictions, we weren't able to conduct many interviews, but we were able to meet with leaders of ODIM to learn more about the non-profit and the communities of San Pablo La Laguna and San Juan La Laguna. This was important for telling our narrative.</p>
							<h2>Design process</h2>
							<p>Because of time constraints, I wanted to use a website template provided by Wix. I only had three days to build the website. However, I searched through all the website templates and I wasn't happy with any of them. Many of them have a modern, minimalistic look and feel to them and many felt like templates for clothing stores. This was not the message I wanted to send to our customers. So, I decided to start from scratch.</p>
							<p>First, I created a basic wireframe on the website and sent it out to the other members of my group to check if the information architecture and layout of the pages were intuitive to them. Then, I began gathering photos from both La Voz and ODIM that I could use on the website. I also came up with an earthy and warm color scheme to use. I wanted the colors to “scream” words like “coffee”, “community”, and “growth”.</p>
							<p>Next, I began writing content for the website. I focused on the tradtional Mayan methods they used and where they grow and harvest their coffee. We included an interactive map to show where the communities were located and information about our project and ODIM. We also came across a story about a Mayan ceremonial site where they held important rituals and we named our brand after them, the Sunken City.</p>
							<p>In the end, I still wasn't convinced by our own storytelling and I came up with the idea to introduce the group and share our morning coffee rituals. This About the Team page was the extra flourish we needed to bring our website to life and differentiate ourselfs from the other teams in the class.</p>
							<p>Lastly, I had users test the website to make sure it was intuitive and easy to use. I also had users test the mobile version and made minor edits based on feeback that they gave me.</p>
							<h2>Final design</h2>
							<p>The website is no longer being hosted, however, here are some screenshots I was able to take:</p>

							<img  src="images/project1/SunkenCityTeam.jpg" alt="" style="height:600px"/>
							<img  src="images/project1/SunkenCityStory2.jpg" alt="" style="height:600px"/>
							<img  src="images/project1/SunkenCityStory1.jpg" alt="" style="height:400px"/>
							<br><br>
							<h2>Impact</h2>
							<p>We sold out of all our coffee in <b><i>five days</i></b> and out-performed all the other teams in the class by raising over <b><i>$2000</i></b> in profits. As a class, we were able to reach our goal of <b><i>$5000</i></b> and donated it to ODIM.</p>
							<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
							<p>Although this wasn't a product design project, I learned and used many skills that are applicable to one. If I were to do this project again wihtout the time contraints, I would spend more time with the user research and the design process. When I completed this project, I didn't know much about design prinicples or about wireframing and prototyping. I designed it based on how it looked aesethically and how it made me feel. Now that I have gain more knowledge and skills, I would like to do more research on user pain points and how to create a more visually appealing and intuitive interface based on design principles I learned. </p>
